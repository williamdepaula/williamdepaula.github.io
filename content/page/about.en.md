My name is William de Paula, I'm a developer with a passion for technology, with expertise in JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript and AWS, especially in the serverless universe.
I currently work creating, integrating and maintaining voice and text chatbots, connecting them to external APIs, databases and other tools to deliver rich and intuitive experiences to users.
With a degree in Information Systems from UFMS, I have one foot in innovation and the other in practicality, always looking for solutions that simplify people's lives.
When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me playing boardgames, exploring nature with my two dogs or enjoying special moments with my teenage girlfriend, who is now my wife. For me, balance is the key: between technology and nature, between professional challenges and moments of relaxation.
After all, life is like a well-written code: it needs logic, but also a touch of creativity and fun!
