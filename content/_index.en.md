## About Me

Developer specializing in JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript and AWS, with a focus on serverless solutions and chatbots for WhatsApp, Telegram and voice. With a degree in Information Systems from UFMS, I love turning code into practical experiences. In my free time, I enjoy boardgames, nature, my two dogs and the company of my teenage girlfriend, who is now my wife.
